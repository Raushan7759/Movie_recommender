# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A recommendation engine that suggests movies based on user preferences, ratings, and collaborative/content-based filtering.

## 🚀 Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similar users' preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies with similar genres, actors, or directors.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both approaches for better accuracy.
- **User Ratings**: Allows users to rate movies for personalized suggestions.
- **Search Functionality**: Find movies by title, genre, or year.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (Express), or Ruby on Rails
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, or HTML/CSS/JS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MongoDB
- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or Surprise (Python)

## 📦 Installation
Set up a virtual environment (Python)

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Python
npm install                     # Node.js
Set up the database

bash
python manage.py migrate        # Django
flask db upgrade                # Flask
Run the app

bash
python app.py                   # Flask
npm start                       # React/Node

## 🌐 Usage
Access the app at http://localhost:5000 (or your specified port).

Rate a few movies to get personalized recommendations.

Search for movies by title, genre, or year.

## 📊 Dataset
Uses MovieLens or TMDB dataset.

Preprocess data with Pandas (data_processing.py).

## 🤖 How the Recommender Works
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interactions (e.g., surprise library).

Content-Based Filtering: Uses TF-IDF/Cosine Similarity on movie metadata.

Hybrid Model: Combines both methods for better results.

## 📈 Performance Metrics
RMSE: 0.85 (lower is better)

Precision@K: 0.78 (higher is better)

## 📝 Future Improvements
Implement Hybrid Filtering: Combine content-based and collaborative filtering for more accurate recommendations.

Enable User Ratings & Profiles: Personalize recommendations based on user behavior and feedback.

Add Search Autocomplete: Improve user experience with real-time movie title suggestions.

Deploy to Cloud Platform: Host the app on Render, Hugging Face, or Heroku for wider access.
